# ARGOS Hotel Optimization Framework

This repository contains reference code, data, and experiment scripts for the paper:

**ARGOS: Adaptive Recursive Gradient Optimization System for Hierarchical Decision-Making**

The code implements:
- Lexicographic Constraint Optimization (LCO)
- Componentwise Approximated Gradient (CAG)
- The unified ARGOS operator (LCO + CAG)
- Dynamic hotel management simulation (single-property and multi-property)
- QUBO formulation helpers
- Ablation studies and hyperparameter sensitivity utilities

The repository is organized for easy extension and reproduction of the main experimental results.
